Assignment 2
Perform Logistic Regression using Convolutional Neural Networks

The dataset is split between two types of files map files and result files

Mapfiles are 2D matrix files saved as CSVâ€™s, you should use the different values as the channels for the CNN. Each cell corresponds to the following data

Empty=0,
Wall=1,
Floor=2,
Spawn1=8,
Spawn2=9,
HealthPack=10


Result files are the results of 100 games and the percent chance that Player 1 or 2 wins with that map.

The task is to predict the probability of Team 1 winning given a map. I recommend using Data Augmentation techniques to create artificial data such as mirroring the data and pixel offsets.
